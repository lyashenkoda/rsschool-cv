I've been working as a software testing engineer at EPAM for more than 6 years. Recently I started to think about changing my career path and decided to join RS School JavaScript course. Even if I won't become a front-end developer, I hope these skills will be useful. 
  
I have a little experience in programming while I was studying in university (C++, C#, Java). Recently I also took several cources on Java and JavaScript on Codecademy and HTML + CSS course on HTML Academy.
