I've been working as a software testing engineer at EPAM for more than 6 years. Recently I started to think about changing my career path and decided to join RS School JavaScript course. Even if I won't become a front-end developer, I hope these skills will be useful. 
  
I have a little experience in programming while I was studying in university (C++, C#, Java). Recently I also took several cources on Java and JavaScript on Codecademy and HTML + CSS course on HTML Academy.  
  
```javascript
//an example from latest codecademy task to see how code looks in GIT markdown
const Airplane = require('./1-airplane.js');

function displayAirplane() {
  console.log(Airplane.myAirplane);
}

displayAirplane();
```
  
I don't have any experience in programming except cources on Codecademy and HTML Academy. Have 6+ years experience in software testing.  
  
Bachelor dergee in informatics and computer engineering, Saratov State University.  
  
B2 according to EPAM English assessment.
